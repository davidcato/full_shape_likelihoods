# FSlik

General likelihood for full-shape analyses.

This includes:
- One-loop power spectrum (P0, P2, P4)
- One-loop real-space power spectrum (Q0)
- Tree-level bispectrum monopole (B0)
- Alcock-Paczynski parameters (AP)

This interfaces with CLASS-PT. To use fNL features, the relevant version of CLASS-PT will be required.
